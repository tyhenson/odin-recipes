    <h3>Simple fried chicken recipe that will have your family thinking you bought take-out</h3>
    <p>     This is my all-time favorite fried chicken recipe. We first started making this recipe back when we were young adults just starting out. 
        We built upon it over the years as our cooking skills developed. It is now a family favorite that is requested more often than people 
        should be eating fried foods.

        The ingredients are as simple as the chicken is delicious. Just a bit of flour, some buttermilk, and a few select spices is all you need to 
        make this amazing dish for your family tonight.
